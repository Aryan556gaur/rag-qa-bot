RAG-Based Question Answering Bot
This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering (QA) bot for answering questions based on uploaded documents (such as PDFs). It uses a vector database (Pinecone) for document retrieval and a generative model (like Cohere API) for generating coherent responses based on the context.

Features
PDF Document Upload: Users can upload PDF documents.
Question Answering: The bot retrieves relevant sections of the document and generates an answer.
Efficient Retrieval: Uses Pinecone DB for efficient document retrieval.
Generative Model: Employs a generative model (Cohere API or other alternatives) to answer user queries.
Chunking for Large Documents: Handles large documents by splitting them into manageable chunks.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Aryan556gaur/rag-qa-bot.git
cd rag-qa-bot
2. Install Dependencies
You can install the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

Using venv or virtualenv:

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirements:

streamlit
PyPDF2
pinecone-client
cohere
3. API Keys Setup
Before running the application, ensure you have your API keys for the following:

Cohere API: Sign up at Cohere to get an API key.
Pinecone DB: Sign up at Pinecone to get your API key.
Add your API keys to your environment variables or directly in your code (not recommended for production):

bash
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your-pinecone-api-key"
export COHERE_API_KEY="your-cohere-api-key"
4. Run the Application
To run the Streamlit app locally, use the following command:

bash
streamlit run app.py
This will start the app and make it accessible at http://localhost:8501.

Using the RAG Model Pipeline (Jupyter Notebook)
For users who wish to experiment with the pipeline separately, the notebook rag_notebook.ipynb demonstrates how the RAG model pipeline works. It includes:

Data loading and chunking from PDF files.
Creating embeddings using Cohere.
Storing and retrieving embeddings from Pinecone.
Generating answers based on retrieved documents.
To run the notebook, install Jupyter and execute:

bash
jupyter notebook rag_notebook.ipynb
Docker Setup
The application is containerized using Docker for easy deployment.

1. Build the Docker Image
Run the following command to build the Docker image:

bash
docker build -t rag-qa-bot .
2. Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run the container:

bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 rag-qa-bot
This will start the application on http://localhost:8501.

How to Use the QA Bot
Upload a PDF Document:
Once the app is running, upload a PDF document through the interface.
Ask a Question:
Type your question based on the uploaded document.
Get Answers:
The bot will retrieve the most relevant chunks from the document and generate an answer. It will also display the relevant text segments used to form the answer.
Deployment Instructions
For production, you can deploy the app using Docker on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP) by:

Setting up a cloud VM or container service.
Installing Docker and following the build and run steps.
Opening the necessary ports (8501) to allow external access.
Challenges and Solutions
Large Documents Handling: The system uses chunking to handle large documents by splitting them into smaller parts, ensuring efficient retrieval.
Performance with Multiple Queries: Pinecone ensures fast vector similarity search, enabling quick response even with multiple queries.
Future Enhancements
Support for Multiple Document Types: Expand to support formats like DOCX or HTML.
Improved Caching: Implement caching for repeated queries to improve response times further.
User Authentication: Add user authentication to restrict access to certain documents.
